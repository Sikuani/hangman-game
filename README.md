## Instructions

- Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words.

- it will be presented with a series of blank spaces that represent the missing letters that you need to find.

- Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with the vowels).

- If the letter you chose exists in the answer, all places in the answer where that letter appears will be revealed.

- After you have revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.

- Be careful, every time you hit a wrong letter, you lose a life.

- You can only enter a letter, you can not enter double letters or numbers.

- You will have a help to warn you which letters you have already typed but not guessed.

- Solve the puzzle before the game ends.

- At the end of the game you can decide whether or not to continue with a new game and the wonderful thing is that your hits and losses will be stored.

Enjoy the game!!
It is fun.
